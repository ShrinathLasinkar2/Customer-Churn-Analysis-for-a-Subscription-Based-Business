## Business Recommendations

### 1. Actionable Insights to Reduce Churn
- **Target Month-to-Month Customers**: Customers on month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn. Offer attractive incentives like discounts or free upgrades to encourage them to switch to longer-term plans.
- **Address High Monthly Charges**: Since churned customers tend to have higher monthly charges, introduce flexible and competitive pricing strategies to reduce churn risk.
- **Enhance Support for High-Risk Segments**: Focus on senior citizens and customers using fiber optic internet, as these groups exhibit higher churn rates. Consider tailored customer service solutions or loyalty programs.
- **Proactive Engagement**: Identify customers with short tenures and high monthly charges as high-risk groups. Engage them through surveys, personalized recommendations, and exclusive promotions.

### 2. Pricing Strategies
- **Introduce Tiered Pricing Models**: Design affordable pricing tiers to cater to different customer segments based on usage and needs.
- **Loyalty Discounts**: Offer loyalty rewards, such as discounts for customers who renew contracts or have stayed longer than a year.
- **Bundling Services**: Provide bundled packages for phone, internet, and other services at discounted rates to increase customer satisfaction and reduce churn.

### 3. Customer Retention Approaches
- **Flexible Payment Methods**: Reduce churn by expanding payment options beyond electronic checks and offering autopay incentives.
- **Customer Onboarding Programs**: Provide onboarding assistance for new customers to ensure they fully understand and utilize the services.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Use machine learning models to identify and target high-risk customers based on tenure, charges, and engagement history.
- **Personalized Marketing**: Send targeted offers and communications based on customer behavior and preferences.
